Updated : 

Simplifying the recv loop in CClientSocket__OnConnect_Hook: The original loop is overly complex and likely buggy, especially how it determines packet length (src = *buffer;) and resets accumulatedBuf. I'll replace it with a more straightforward receive logic, followed by careful parsing with checks after each decode operation.

Correcting memory leaks in MemEdit::WriteBytes calls by using stack-allocated arrays for patch bytes instead of new BYTE[].

Clarifying logic in CWvsApp__ConnectLogin_Hook's message handling for WM_SOCKET.

Streamlining error checking in CWvsApp__Run_Hook.
